# Principles-of-Programming-Language
Projects for CSE340

Project 1 : The goal of this project is to give you hands-on experience with lexical analysis. You will extend the provided
lexical analyzer to support more token types.

Project 2: In this project, you will write a C or C++ program that reads a description of a context free grammar, then, depending on the command line argument passed to the program, performs one of the following tasks: 1) for each terminal and non-terminal in the grammar determine the number of grammar rules in which the symbol appears, 2) determine useless symbols in the grammar and remove them, 3) calculate FIRST sets, 4) calculate FOLLOW sets and 5) determine if the grammar has a predictive parser.

Project 3: Goal is to write a predictive parser and write a type checker for a given language.

Project 4: Implementing a small compiler. You will write a compiler for a simple language. You will not be generating assembly code. Instead, you will generate an intermediate representation (a data structure that represents the program). The execution of the program will be done after compilation by interpreting the generated intermediate representation.
